# Mew

Mew (named after Pok√©mon) is a programming language created for programming in self-written OS kernels and popular systems

It uses [PLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply) as lexer and parser.

# Development

Yes, it's another programming language I writing 4th time

# Dependcies

Mew depends on 2 functions at the moment:

- `malloc()`
- `free()`

# Platforms

Mew uses target system that can be extended by adding `targetname` folder in the `mew_pl/` folder and putting files into it:

For example (Linux: `targets/linux`) should contain files:

- `defs.h` - type definitons
- `alloc.h` - allocation functions

For any other platform, your `targetname` folder should contain these files too to reach compatibility.

!!!: Every `targetname` folder should contain empty `__init__.py` file to force pip to add it to package.

# Installation

Run ```pip install https://github.com/NDRAEY/Mew/archive/main.zip``` to install latest commit from GitHub repo.
